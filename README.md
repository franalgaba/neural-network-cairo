# Neural Network for MNIST in Cairo 1.0

Implementation of a Neural Network from scratch using Cairo 1.0 for MNIST predictions.

The NN has a simple two-layer architecture: 
  - Input layer ùëé[0] will have 784 units corresponding to the 784 pixels in each 28x28 input image. 
  - A hidden layer ùëé[1] will have 10 units with ReLU activation.
  - Output layer ùëé[2] will have 10 units corresponding to the ten digit classes with softmax activation.

Functionalities implemented in Cairo 1.0:
 - [X] Matrix implementation.
 - [X] Tensor implementation.
 - [X] 8-bit weight quantization based in [ONNX quantization](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/performance/quantization.html#quantization-overview).
 - [X] ReLU activation.
 - [ ] [Pseudo-softmax activation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-94691-7) optimized for quantized values.

## Working with the project

Currently supports building and testing contracts.

### Build

Build the contracts.

```bash
$ make build
```

### Test

Run the tests in `src/test`:

```bash
$ make test
```

### Format

Format the Cairo source code (using Scarb):

```bash
$ make fmt
```
